# recreating-snp500-indices
In short, this project includes:

1) Creating an order form to mimic an equal-weighted S&P500, using current randomized data from IEX Cloud's API
2) Recreating the S&P500, both capitalization-weighted and equal-weighted, using historical data from the yfinance library 
3) Comparing the two S&P500's by analyzing their correlation, returns, and volatility
